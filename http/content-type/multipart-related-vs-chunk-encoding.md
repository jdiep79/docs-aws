Yes, **`multipart/related` and `chunked encoding` are two different concepts** in HTTP, but they can be used together or separately. Let‚Äôs break them down.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ multipart/related** (MIME Type)

- **What it does:**

  - Defines how multiple parts of a request or response are structured.
  - Used when sending related data, such as metadata and a file together.
  - Each part has its own `Content-Type` (e.g., `application/json`, `image/png`).
  - Requires a `boundary` to separate the parts.

- **Example (`multipart/related` request without chunked encoding):**

  ```http
  POST /upload HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=example-boundary
  Content-Length: 3876

  --example-boundary
  Content-Type: application/json

  { "name": "profile-pic", "description": "User profile picture" }
  --example-boundary
  Content-Type: image/png
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

  (binary image data)
  --example-boundary--
  ```

- **Does it require `chunked encoding`?**  
  ‚ùå No, `multipart/related` is just a **format**. You can send it with or without chunked encoding.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Transfer-Encoding: chunked** (HTTP Transfer Mechanism)

- **What it does:**

  - Allows sending the HTTP body in chunks **without knowing the total size** beforehand.
  - Each chunk is prefixed with its size in hex.
  - Common in streaming APIs or large file uploads.

- **Example (`chunked` response without multipart/related):**

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked

- **Does it require `multipart/related`?**  
  ‚ùå No, `chunked encoding` is just a **transfer method**. You can use it with JSON, HTML, or anything.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Can They Be Used Together?**

Yes! You can send a **`multipart/related` request using `chunked encoding`** if the total size is unknown.

### **Example (`multipart/related` + chunked encoding)**

```http
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=example-boundary
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

(binary image data)
--example-boundary--
```

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                    | `multipart/related`                      | `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                    | Groups related parts (e.g., JSON + file) | Streams data in chunks                  |
| Requires `boundary`?       | ‚úÖ Yes                                   | ‚ùå No                                   |
| Requires `Content-Length`? | ‚úÖ Yes (if not chunked)                  | ‚ùå No                                   |
| Can be used alone?         | ‚úÖ Yes                                   | ‚úÖ Yes                                  |
| Common Use Cases           | File uploads, email attachments, APIs    | Streaming responses, large file uploads |

### **Summary**

‚úî `multipart/related` = MIME type for **structuring** multiple parts.  
‚úî `chunked encoding` = HTTP mechanism for **sending data without a fixed size**.  
‚úî They are **independent** but can be **used together**.
